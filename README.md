# My First PHP Page

This is a simple, single-page website created with a combination of HTML, CSS, and PHP. It's designed to showcase a basic PHP script (`echo`) running on a server and integrates a playful, "bubble" themed design using CSS.

### Features
* **Simple PHP Integration**: The page uses a single PHP command to dynamically display a welcome message.
* **Bubble Theme**: The design incorporates soft colors, rounded corners, and a subtle hover effect to create a friendly, "bubbly" aesthetic.
* **Responsive Layout**: The content box is centered on the page and adjusts to different screen sizes.

### Technologies Used
* **PHP**: For server-side scripting.
* **HTML**: For the page structure.
* **CSS**: For styling and layout.
